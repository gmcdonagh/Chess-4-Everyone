   <p>This is a chess game that allows for all people to play. In the Settings page, you will find many player select and degree of freedom options.</p>
   <p>A limited player is given options while playing their game. An unlimited player has no options while playing, so they can freely move their pieces however they please.</p>
   <p>One degree of freedom allows for only one move to be picked by the player at their lesiure. Two degrees of freedom allow for two options per chess move. Finally, three degrees of freedom allow for three options for each chess move.</p>
   <p>A FEN string is a code that corresponds to the player's current position in their chess game.</p>
